## Machine Learning Fundamentals {#fundamentals}

### **What is Machine Learning?**
Machine Learning (ML) is a programming paradigm that enables computers to learn patterns from data rather than following explicit instructions. It creates models that learn from training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### **ML vs. Traditional Programming**

| Traditional Programming | Machine Learning |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **Explicit Instructions**: Precisely defined input-output transformations | **Pattern Learning**: Logic learned from data patterns |
| **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output | **Probabilistic**: Handles uncertainty and makes predictions |
| **Limited Scope**: Difficult to handle uncertainty and complex patterns | **Generalization**: Can handle tasks where programming explicit solutions is impractical |

### **Related Fields Hierarchy**

## ML Taxonomy and Types {#taxonomy}

### **Core Data Structure**
- **Dataset**: Collection of data used in machine learning
- **Data Matrix**: Structured table with rows and columns
- **Features (X)**: Input variables/attributes in columns that describe the data
- **Labels (y)**: Target variable we want to predict
- **Example/Data Point**: Single instance of data (one row in data matrix)

### **Supervised Learning**
**Definition**: Attempts to discover relationships between features and labels for future prediction using labeled examples.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Training data uses labeled examples as input
- Goal: Learn to predict labels based on features
- Supervision: Label provides feedback on model correctness
- Two phases: Training phase (build model) and prediction/inference phase (make predictions)

**Types of Supervised Learning**:

#### **Classification**
- **Definition**: Predicts discrete/categorical values (classes)
- **Output**: Categories or class probability membership
- **Binary Classification**: Two possible outcomes (spam/not spam, fraud/not fraud)
- **Multiclass Classification**: Multiple categories (animal types, weather conditions)

#### **Regression**
- **Definition**: Predicts continuous/numerical values
- **Output**: Real-valued numbers (prices, temperatures, heights)
- **Key difference**: "Closeness" to correct answer matters

**Decision Rule**: Use regression when being "close" matters (predicting height: 182cm vs 183cm is close). Use classification when errors are binary - right or wrong, no similarity between classes.

### **Unsupervised Learning**
**Definition**: Discovers patterns in data without using labeled examples. Finds hidden structures and relationships in data.

**Key Characteristics**:
- No labels: Works with unlabeled data only
- Pattern discovery: Identifies hidden structures
- Subjective interpretation: Requires human insight to derive business value
- No accuracy metrics: Can't measure "correctness" like supervised learning

**Main Technique: Clustering**
- Groups data into clusters based on similarity
- Goal: Members within clusters are similar; different from other clusters
- Applications: Customer segmentation, market research, recommendation systems

### **Generalization**
**Definition**: A model's ability to adapt to new, previously unseen data that is similar to training data.

**Critical Importance**: Determines model effectiveness and real-world value. The goal is to learn patterns that apply beyond training data.
