**credit lending business problem**. Here's a summary:

## Business Problem
A credit lending startup wants to build a credit scoring system to make better lending decisions and reduce risk.

## Problem Translation to Machine Learning
- **Goal**: Build a default prediction model
- **Definition**: Default = missing three consecutive payments in the first six months
- **Problem Type**: Binary classification (default: yes/no)

## Data Collection Challenge
- **Cold Start Problem**: New companies often lack historical data
- **Solution**: Experimental approach - initially give credit to everyone who applies
- **Data Collected**: Age and income as main predictors, plus 6-month default outcomes

## Traditional vs. Machine Learning Approach

**Traditional Heuristics**:
- Simple rules like "only lend to people earning >$50k"
- Problems: Leaves value on the table, historically discriminatory, imprecise

**Machine Learning Approach**:
- Uses mathematical optimization to find the optimal decision boundary
- Creates regions that minimize prediction errors through model training
- More precise than human intuition alone

## Key Advantages of Machine Learning

1. **Scalability**: Works with hundreds of features, not just two
2. **Precision**: Mathematical optimization beats human heuristics
3. **Nuanced Decisions**: Can use distance from decision boundary to set appropriate credit limits
4. **Fairness**: Treats customers with similar risk profiles equally, regardless of superficial differences

## Practical Application
Once trained, the model can predict risk for new credit applicants based on their age and income, enabling more informed and fair lending decisions while managing business risk effectively.

The example demonstrates how supervised learning transforms a business problem into a mathematical optimization problem that can be solved systematically.
