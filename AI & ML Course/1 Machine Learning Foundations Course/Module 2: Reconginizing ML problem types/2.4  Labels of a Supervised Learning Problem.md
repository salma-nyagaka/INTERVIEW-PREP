#### Binary
- When the label we are trying to predict belongs to only two possible distinct values

#### Multiclass
- When the label we are trying to predict belongs to multiple distinct values
    - What animal is in a given image? Cat, dog, rabbit, or wookiee.
    - What is the weather forecast for tomorrow? Sunny, cloudy, rain, or thunderstorm.

#### Regression
- There are infinite possible label values.
- The label we are trying to predict belongs to a real number
   - What is the height of the animal in a given image?
    - What is the temperature forecast for tomorrow?

**Regression vs. Classification** depends on the nature of the output variable and how prediction errors should be interpreted. Regression predicts continuous numerical values where being "close" to the correct answer matters, such as predicting someone's height based on gender, weight, and age. If height prediction were treated as classification with 1cm increments, predicting 182cm for someone who is actually 183cm would be considered the same error as predicting 140cm, which doesn't reflect reality since 182cm is much closer to the truth. Classification predicts discrete categories where errors are binary - you're either right or wrong with no assumption of similarity between classes. Facial recognition exemplifies this, where identifying Bill Gates versus Steve Jobs versus Linus Torvalds represents distinct, separate categories with no meaningful ordering or similarity. Most problems have a natural choice based on whether the output should be treated as a continuous value or discrete category.
