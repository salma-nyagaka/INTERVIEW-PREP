## Unsupervised Learning Example: Customer Segmentation

**Business Problem:**
- Credit lending company wants to create tailored products for different customer types
- Goal: Build different lending products targeted to specific customer needs at application time

**Machine Learning Translation:**
- "Can we identify clusters of similar customers based on their application-time attributes?"
- No specific outcome to predict (unlike supervised learning)
- Keywords "cluster" and "similar" indicate unsupervised learning

**Data and Approach:**
- Uses only application-time data (age and income) 
- Creates scatterplot visualization
- Applies clustering algorithms to segment customers into four groups
- Members within clusters are similar; different from other clusters

**Key Differences from Supervised Learning:**
- No prediction target or accuracy metrics
- Requires subjective interpretation to derive business value
- Focus on discovering hidden patterns rather than making predictions

**Implementation Process:**
- Analyze clusters to create meaningful customer profiles
- Use qualitative research (interviews/surveys) to understand segments
- Develop stylized descriptions for each segment
- Design specific lending products for each segment's needs

**Business Value:**
- Enables serving diverse customer needs while managing risk
- Data-driven method for product development and customer targeting
- Supports goal of providing credit access without bankrupting company or customers
