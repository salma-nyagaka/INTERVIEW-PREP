**Machine Learning Overview**
Machine learning encompasses various algorithms that serve as building blocks for sophisticated applications. These methods fall into two main families: supervised and unsupervised learning.

**Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves inferring rules or functions from labeled data. Key concepts include:

- **Data Structure**: Organized as matrices with rows (examples/entities) and columns (attributes)
- **Features (X)**: Input attributes used by the model (e.g., transaction amount, merchant category)
- **Labels (y)**: The target variable you're trying to predict (e.g., whether a transaction is fraudulent)
- **Training Process**: The label supervises learning by providing feedback on model correctness

Supervised learning has two main types based on label characteristics:
- **Regression**: Predicts continuous numerical values (e.g., stock prices, customer spending)
- **Classification**: Predicts categorical values
  - Binary classification: Yes/no questions (e.g., spam detection)
  - Multiclass classification: Multiple categories (e.g., topic classification, digit recognition)

**Unsupervised Learning**
This approach finds patterns in data without labels. The most common application is clustering - identifying groups or segments with similar characteristics. A practical example is music streaming services grouping listeners with similar tastes to improve recommendations.

**Key Distinction**
The presence or absence of labels determines whether a problem is supervised (with labels for training) or unsupervised (pattern discovery without labels).
