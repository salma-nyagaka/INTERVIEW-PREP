2. Machine Learning (ML) - A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
3. Deep Learning - A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks
4. Data Science - The discipline of finding patterns and insights in data by combining statistics, programming and domain knowledge
