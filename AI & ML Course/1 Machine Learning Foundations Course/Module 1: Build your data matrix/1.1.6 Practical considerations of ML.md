# Machine Learning: Essential Guidelines and Limitations

Machine learning is a powerful tool but comes with important constraints that practitioners must recognize:

## Application-driven approach
Let specific problems determine if ML is appropriate, not vice versa. ML is simply one tool among many.

## Data requirements are specific
Success depends on having:
- Correctly labeled examples (right answers)
- Relevant predictive features
- Sufficient sample size for the problem complexity

## Heuristics retain value
Simple, tested business logic often provides effective solutions when data is insufficient. Many successful ML implementations begin as heuristics before evolving.
- a rule of thumb or simplifying assumption that:
- Guides search or learning (e.g., in optimization or decision trees)
- Helps make decisions with limited information or time
- Is often based on experience, domain knowledge, or intuition

## Ethical responsibility is paramount
ML practitioners must:
- Respect privacy (each data point typically represents a real person)
- Consider real-world impact (ML decisions affect loans, employment, relationships)
- Evaluate models for fairness and potential harm at scale

The fundamentals of machine learning remain critical to implementing ethical AI systems.
