#### 1. What is the business objective of the underlying ML algorithm?

- "According to the Regreening Africa website, the underlying machine learning business objective in World Agroforestry is to map and predict soil organic carbon levels across diverse landscapes in Kenya and other African countries.

- Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is stored in the soil and derived from decomposed plant and animal matter. It improves soil structure, enhances water retention, and promotes nutrient availability. Soils rich in organic carbon are more fertile and better able to support plant growth."

#### 2. What label would you use, and can you think of three features you might build to predict it?

###### Label to use.

- Soil Organic Carbon.

###### Futures I might build to predict it.

- Climate indicators: Regional precipitation patterns and temperature variations influencing SOC levels.

- Vegetation indices: Satellite-derived data assessing plant cover density and health.

- Land degradation metrics: Factors such as soil erosion prevalence, implementation of soil and water conservation measures, and rock or stone cover presence. "

 

#### 3. Why do you think Machine Learning is the right approach to achieve the underlying objective?

- It can effectively integrate diverse data sources, including remote sensing information, climate records, and soil samples, leading to more comprehensive predictions.ICRAF (n.d.). Final reports summary. Regreening Africa.

- Once trained, ML models can efficiently estimate SOC levels across vast areas, facilitating large-scale land health monitoring.

- The iterative nature of ML allows for continuous improvement as new field data becomes available, progressively enhancing prediction accuracy.

- Machine learning empowers end users to make better-informed decisions regarding agroforestry, farming practices, carbon capture, land restoration, and agricultural productivity.
