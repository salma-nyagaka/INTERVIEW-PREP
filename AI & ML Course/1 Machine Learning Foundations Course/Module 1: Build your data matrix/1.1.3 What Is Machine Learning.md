1. **Definition of Machine Learning**: ML is a paradigm of programming that enables computers to learn from data rather than following explicit instructions. It creates models that learn patterns from training data to make predictions on new data.

2. **Traditional vs ML Programming**: Traditional programming requires explicitly defined input-output transformations, whereas ML can handle tasks involving uncertainty and prediction where programming explicit solutions is impractical.

3. **ML Applications** shown as examples:
   - Identifying spam vs. non-spam emails
   - Recognizing dogs or cats in images
   - Predicting housing prices
   - Recommending products based on consumer behavior

4. **Supervised Learning Focus**: The course appears to emphasize supervised learning, where models learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new inputs.

5. **Generalization**: A key concept highlighted is the ability of ML models to generalize from training data to make accurate predictions on previously unseen data.

6. **Data Structure**: The page shows that training data is organized in table format (data matrix or dataframe) with examples of email classification features.

7. **Data  matrix**: Rows and columns -> in python  a data frame/data set.

8. **Example/data point**: Each row in t able
## Email Classification Example Table

The page includes a data table example showing email classification features:

| Email sender | Email subject | Recognized IP | Contains word "advertisement" | SPAM |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|------------------------------|------|
| Frank's Restaurant and Bar | Eat at Frank's | No | Yes | Yes |
| Mom | Monday at 4 | Yes | No | No |
| Trinket Land | 10 percent off | Yes | Yes | Yes |
