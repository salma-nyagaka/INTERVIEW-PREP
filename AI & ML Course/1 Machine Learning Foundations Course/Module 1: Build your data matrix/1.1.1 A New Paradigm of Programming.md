## Machine learning can be viewed as a new programming paradigm where:

- Logic is learned from data patterns rather than explicitly written
- A "model" serves as a data object representing observed patterns
- Models function like traditional functions, mapping inputs to outputs
- ML engineers control how logic is learned through optimization algorithms

While mathematical foundations are important for mastery, practitioners can effectively approach ML as another programming method for solving problems.

Machine learning components ultimately integrate into larger software systems designed for specific business purposes, functioning alongside traditionally programmed components.
