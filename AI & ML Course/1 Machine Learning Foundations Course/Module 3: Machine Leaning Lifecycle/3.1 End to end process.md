**Summary:**

The core of machine learning lies in computational algorithms based on mathematics like calculus, linear algebra, and information theory. While the math is foundational, tools like Python's scikit-learn abstract much of it away. For practitioners, the focus is on the **process of building models**, more than the algorithms themselves.

A widely adopted framework for this is **CRISP-DM** (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), an iterative and non-linear process that remains relevant today. It includes six key steps:

1. **Business Understanding** – Define the problem clearly, considering both domain and technical perspectives. Often starts with a written project brief.
2. **Data Understanding & Preparation** – Treated as a continuous phase, this step involves gathering and cleaning data. It’s often the most time-consuming.
3. **Modeling & Evaluation** – Includes selecting and testing models. Ironically, despite being the essence of ML, these steps take the least time thanks to automation.
4. **Deployment** – The final step where the model is put into use. This step involves software development and often distinguishes ML engineers from data scientists.

The process is cyclical and iterative—models are continually improved. The course emphasizes both the **science and art** of machine learning, especially focusing on the often-overlooked early phases of data work, drawing on nearly two decades of real-world experience.
