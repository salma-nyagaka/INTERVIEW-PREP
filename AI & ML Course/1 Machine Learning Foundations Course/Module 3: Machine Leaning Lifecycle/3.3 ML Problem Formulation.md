The **first stage in the machine learning (ML) development lifecycle** is **problem formulation**, which is more of an *art* than a *science*. Unlike later stages, it lacks formal methods and is best learned through **on-the-job experience**.

### Key Principles for Problem Formulation:

When working on practice problems (where the problem is often already defined), you can still build your skills by asking these four guiding questions:

1. **What problem is the model solving, and why is ML better than a non-ML solution?**
2. **What kind of data is needed to solve the problem with ML?**
3. **How would you solve the problem without ML?**
4. **What potential risks should be anticipated?**

### In Real-World Work:

* **Don’t formulate the problem alone** – Collaborate with stakeholders and domain experts to define the problem accurately.
* **Understand constraints** – These include data availability, performance requirements, timelines, or ethical concerns.
* **Be agile and iterative** – Start with **simple heuristics** to deliver quick value, then improve the system in manageable steps.
* **Know when to stop iterating** – After a point, further model tuning brings diminishing returns. It may be better to move on to a new problem.

By consistently practicing these principles—even with simple exercises—you’ll strengthen your ability to frame ML problems effectively in real-world contexts.
