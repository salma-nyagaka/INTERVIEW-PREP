**Summary:**

This section compares two key professional roles in machine learning: **Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer (MLE)**. Although their responsibilities vary across companies, a general rule is that an MLE is **an engineer first**â€”strong in computer science fundamentals (like algorithms, data structures, and software development). Internships are often crucial for gaining practical experience.

MLE interviews typically test:

1. **Computer science fundamentals**
2. **Machine learning theory and application**
3. **Software development and deployment**
4. **The ML development process**
5. **Subjective judgment and tradeoffs** in model development

While data scientists may focus more on analysis and experimentation, **MLEs are responsible for building, deploying, and maintaining production-ready ML systems**. In tech-forward environments, this may even involve automating the entire ML pipeline.

The role also involves managing two types of risks:

* **System risks**: ML systems are complex and require rigorous testing and monitoring to prevent failure.
* **Ethical risks**: Models can unintentionally harm underrepresented groups, as average performance often hides performance gaps across populations.

Because **automated systems are increasingly making critical decisions**, MLEs play a vital role in **anticipating and mitigating these risks**, ensuring models are safe, fair, and reliable.
