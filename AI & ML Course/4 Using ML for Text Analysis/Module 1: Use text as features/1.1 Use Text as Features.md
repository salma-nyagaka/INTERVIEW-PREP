This module covers how to convert text data into numeric format for machine learning models while preserving meaning. It focuses on natural language processing techniques like tokenization and vectorization. The module concludes with a hands-on demo where you'll preprocess book review data using vectorization techniques to prepare it for sentiment analysis - determining whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
