This video explains **three common methods** for converting preprocessed word tokens into **numeric features**—a process known as **vectorization**. This step is essential for enabling machine learning models to process textual data.

---

### 🔢 **1. Binary Vectorization**

* Assigns a **1** if a token is **present** in a document, otherwise **0**.
* Ignores how many times the word appears—just cares about presence.

---

### 🔢 **2. Count Vectorization**

* Assigns the **number of times** a token appears in the document.
* Simple, but common words may dominate the representation.

---

### 📊 **3. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**

* A more **refined weighting**:

  * **Term Frequency (TF)**: Frequency of the word in the document.
  * **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Penalizes words that appear across many documents.
* Words that are **frequent in one doc but rare overall** get **higher weights**, making this method useful for highlighting distinctive terms.

---

### ⚙️ **Implementation (Scikit-learn TF-IDF Vectorizer)**

* **Instantiate** the vectorizer with preprocessing settings.
* **Fit** on training data to learn token mappings.
* **Transform** training, test, and validation data using the same fitted object to maintain consistency.

---

### 📌 Key Takeaway:

Choose the vectorization method based on task complexity:

* **Binary** for simple tasks.
* **Count** when frequency matters.
* **TF-IDF** for nuanced importance across documents.

Always ensure **the same transformations** are applied to both training and test data using the same vectorizer object.
