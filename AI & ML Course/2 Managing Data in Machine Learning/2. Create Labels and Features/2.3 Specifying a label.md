### **Summary: Defining Labels in Machine Learning**

Defining the **label** is a critical and often underestimated step in supervised machine learning. It's closely tied to the **problem statement** and influences nearly every part of model development.

---

#### **Clear Label Scenarios (Easy Cases):**

* **Well-defined outcomes**, like yes/no or categorical options.
* **Directly observable labels** (e.g., ad clicks, digit recognition).
* **Each input maps cleanly to one label.**

---

#### **Challenging Label Scenarios:**

* **Subjective goals** (e.g., user satisfaction).
* **Unobservable or abstract labels**.
* **Multiple valid interpretations or outcomes**.
* **Long-term goals with delayed feedback** (e.g., retention after 90 days).

To handle these, we often use **proxies**:

* Example: Instead of long-term retention, we use short-term engagement (clicks, likes).
* However, proxies introduce their own limitations and complexity.

---

#### **Simplification Strategies:**

* **Convert complex outcomes into simpler tasks**, such as:

  * Turning **ordinal ratings (1–5)** into binary classes (e.g., high vs. low).
  * Predicting **whether an event will happen by a certain time** instead of the exact time.
* These simplifications make models easier to train and deploy.

---

#### **Key Takeaways:**

* Label design is **subjective** and often **iterative**.
* Changing the label **changes the problem**.
* Labeling decisions should be treated with the same rigor as other modeling steps.
* **Peer review and collaboration** help ensure alignment with the problem's intent.

Defining labels isn't just technical—it's strategic, and it's one of the **most impactful decisions** in machine learning.
