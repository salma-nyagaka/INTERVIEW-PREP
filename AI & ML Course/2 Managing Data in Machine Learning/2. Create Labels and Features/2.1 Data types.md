### **Summary: Data Preparation and Data Types in Machine Learning**

Data preparation is a crucial yet often overlooked step in model development. While the model gets the spotlight, most of the time is spent preparing data—much of which may not even make it into the final model. Good data prep directly impacts the quality of results.

A key part of data prep involves understanding **data types**, which influences how features are treated and models are trained. Though all machine learning models operate on numbers, data types affect preprocessing and labeling choices:

* **Continuous (Float)**: Ready for modeling but may contain outliers and skewed distributions. Used as features or regression labels.
* **Integer**: Similar to continuous data but often represent counts. Can also be regression labels, though output might be non-integer.
* **Ordinal**: Categorical with inherent order but without meaningful differences between values. Used as features or labels (regression/classification), but best treated with techniques like binary encoding to avoid misinterpretation.
* **Nominal (Categorical)**: No inherent order. Often stored as strings or encoded integers. Must be transformed (e.g., via one-hot encoding) before being used in models. Commonly used in classification tasks.

Understanding and correctly processing each data type ensures your features and labels are accurately represented, which is foundational for effective model training.
