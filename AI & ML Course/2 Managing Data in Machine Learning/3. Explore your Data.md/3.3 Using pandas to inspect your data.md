In **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, a key focus is checking **data quality**, specifically identifying **missing values** and **outliers**. An efficient way to do this in **Pandas** is by using the `.describe()` method on a DataFrame.

### Key Points:

* **`.describe()`** provides summary statistics like count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles.
* **Missing values** can be spotted when the `count` is lower than expected for a column.
* **Class imbalance** can be identified by inspecting the mean of a **binary label** (e.g., average near 0 means very few positive cases).
* A **mean much higher than the median** indicates **skewness**, often caused by **outliers**.
* **Negative values** in columns meant to represent counts (like `uniq_urls`) are likely errors and need investigation.
* The output of `.describe()` is also a data object, so it can be used in **automated tests** to flag quality issues programmatically.

### Takeaway:

Using `.describe()` is a **simple yet powerful** first step for uncovering data quality problems and gaining insights during EDA. Itâ€™s recommended for every new dataset.
