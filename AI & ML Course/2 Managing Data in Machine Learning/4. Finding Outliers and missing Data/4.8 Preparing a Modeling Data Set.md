#### 1. What does it mean to have a “modeling data set”? 

A modeling data set refers to data that has gone through a complete preparation process, including problem definition, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, and feature engineering. This involves having clean data with appropriate sampling to ensure it represents the production environment, proper labeling for supervised learning, organization into a structured data matrix format where rows represent examples and columns represent labels, and engineered features that are compatible with the intended machine learning model. The dataset should be free of missing values and unwanted outliers, with any necessary cleaning steps like winsorization already applied, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models.

#### 2. What steps would you take with a raw data set to end up with a modeling data set?

1. Data understanding
- The process starts with defining the problem by outlining what needs to be modeled and forming a clear problem statement.
- Next is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we load the data, analyze it statistically, and create visualizations. These help us understand key characteristics such as skewness, distributions, and outliers, which guide data preparation.

2. Data preparation
- Data preparation includes a few key steps.
- Sampling of data by drawing it from the environment and ensuring that the data is identically distributed.
- Label specification defines the true values for supervised learning and helps determine the type of model to use.
- Organizing the data into a matrix structures it into rows for examples and columns for features or labels.
- Data cleaning then deals with issues like missing values and outliers, using techniques like removing rows or winsorization to make the dataset clean and reliable.

3. Modeling

- This is done by Feature engineering which involves transforming data into a format that works well with machine learning models, making sure it’s properly represented and optimized for the model’s needs.
