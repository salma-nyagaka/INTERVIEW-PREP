**Summary:**

To humanize data practices, we must integrate concepts from the social sciences and humanities, recognizing that technology operates within broader historical, political, social, cultural, and economic contexts. Equity should be embedded at every stage of the data pipeline — from collection and storage to analysis, modeling, and visualization. Human involvement is essential for context and ethical decision-making throughout. This isn’t a checklist but a mindset of continuous, situational awareness and thoughtful adjustments tailored to each project.
