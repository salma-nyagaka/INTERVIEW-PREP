### Some of the possible reasons that outliers can occur include the following:
- Human error (e.g., entry error)
- System error (e.g., integer overflow)
- Legitimate value but is unrepresentative of the typical scenario

- A machine learning engineer would typically start out by plotting a feature or the label as a histogram or, in the bivariate scenario, a scatter plot. These plots allow us to easily visualize whether outliers are present and what strategies we may need to utilize to further handle them.

##### There are two common approaches for detecting and separating out outliers: z-score and IQR.
### üîπ **Outlier Detection Methods**

Outliers can arise due to:

* Human or system error,
* Legitimate but rare values not representative of the typical pattern.

#### 1. **Z-score Method**

* The idea of z-score is to take a data point x, subtract the mean of the data set from it, and divide it by the standard deviation of the data set. When a data point has a z-score whose absolute value is higher than 3, it is usually considered an outlier. In a normal distribution, 99.7% of all points in a data set are expected to fall within a z-score of 3. While z=3 is a commonly used and acceptable threshold, an MLE can adjust the z-score used to test for outliers higher or lower as required.


  $$
  z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}
  $$
* **Z > 3** is typically flagged as an outlier.
* Assumes normal distribution.

#### 2. **IQR Method**

* More robust to non-normal data.
* Uses the spread of the middle 50% of the data to flag extreme points (as explained above).
* Often paired with box plots for visualization.



* **IQR = Q3 - Q1**, where:

  * **Q1** is the 25th percentile (lower quartile),
  * **Q3** is the 75th percentile (upper quartile).
* **Outlier boundaries** are calculated as:

  * **Lower bound** = Q1 ‚àí *K* √ó IQR
  * **Upper bound** = Q3 + *K* √ó IQR
  * *K* is often set to 1.5 or 2, based on the problem context.
* Any point outside this range is considered an **outlier**.
* A **box-and-whisker plot** visually represents this concept, with:

  * The box covering Q1 to Q3,
  * Whiskers extending up to the threshold,
  * Points beyond the whiskers marked as outliers.

### ‚≠ê **Key Points**

* **Z-score** highlights distance from the mean ‚Äî good for normally distributed data.
* **IQR** focuses on range and is better for skewed or non-normal distributions.
* Outliers must be investigated regardless of whether they result from errors or true anomalies.
