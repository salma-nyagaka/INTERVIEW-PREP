### **Understanding and Handling Outliers in Data**

#### **What Are Outliers?**

Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset. They can be:

* **Univariate** (visible in a single feature)
* **Multivariate** (visible in combination with other features)

Outlier detection is somewhat **subjective**, as the cutoff threshold varies depending on the context and goal.

### **Why Outliers Matter**

* **Distort statistical measures** like mean and standard deviation
* **Increase variance**, making models less stable
* **Can indicate data collection errors**
* **Cause unreliable model predictions** due to being in sparse data regions

### **How to Detect Outliers**

#### 1. **Z-score Method**

* Calculates how many standard deviations a point is from the mean
* Formula:
  `Z = (value - mean) / std_dev`
* Threshold: usually |Z| > 3

#### 2. **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method**

* IQR = 75th percentile − 25th percentile
* Points beyond **K × IQR** from the quartiles are flagged as outliers
* Commonly used in box plots

### **How to Handle Outliers**

1. **Remove** the outlier if it’s rare or likely caused by error
2. **Winsorize** the data by capping outliers at a set threshold (e.g., 99.9th percentile), reducing skew without deletion

### **Takeaway**

Outliers are a common but important issue in data analysis. You should detect them using data-driven methods like Z-score or IQR, and address them thoughtfully—either by removal or transformation—to improve model performance and data reliability.
