## Measures of Centrality

Statistics uses various methods to measure the **centrality** of data — a way to summarize a large amount of information. The three basic measures are:

### **Mean**
The mean is the average of a series of numerical values. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations.  
> **Note**: While other types of means exist (e.g., geometric, harmonic), "mean" usually refers to the **arithmetic mean**.

### **Median**
The median is the middle value in a sorted list (from lowest to highest).  
- If there is an **odd** number of values: the middle value is the median.  
- If there is an **even** number of values: the median is the mean of the two middle values.

### **Mode**
The mode is the **most frequent** value in a series.  
- If a series has **multiple modes**, it is called **multimodal**.  
- This is often illustrated with a **histogram** with multiple peaks (local modes).

## Measures of Spread and Variation

Understanding how values relate to the center is also important. These concepts include variance, standard deviation, percentiles, z-scores, and outliers.

### **Variance**
Variance is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean.  
Lower variance = data closer to the mean  
Higher variance = data more spread out

### **Standard Deviation**
The standard deviation (σ) is the **square root of the variance**.  
- Like variance, lower values mean tighter clustering around the mean.  
- It provides a unit-consistent measure of spread.

### **Distribution**
A **distribution** describes how values are spread across their range (from min to max).  
- Commonly visualized using **histograms**  
- Certain distributions (e.g., **Normal**, **Gamma**, **Poisson**, **Dirichlet**) have well-defined mathematical properties.

## Percentiles and Quantiles

### **Percentile**
A percentile is a value below which a given percentage of data falls.  
- Example: the 90th percentile = 90% of data is below this value  
- **Quantile** is the same concept expressed as a decimal (0.90 = 90th percentile)

### **Quartiles**
- **Q1** = 25th percentile  
- **Q2** = 50th percentile (Median)  
- **Q3** = 75th percentile

### **Interquartile Range (IQR)**
IQR = Q3 − Q1  
This measures the range of the middle 50% of the data.

## Outliers and Z-Scores

### **Outlier**
An outlier is a data point significantly different from others.  
- May indicate an error or reveal an important pattern  
- Common detection method: points beyond a certain **IQR** or **z-score** threshold

### **Z-score**
The **z-score** measures how many **standard deviations** a data point is from the mean.  
- Example: z = 1 → 1 std. dev. **above** the mean  
- Example: z = -1.5 → 1.5 std. dev. **below** the mean
