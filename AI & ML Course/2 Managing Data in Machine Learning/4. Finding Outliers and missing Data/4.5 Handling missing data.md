### üîç **Handling Missing Data in Machine Learning**

**Causes of Missing Data:**

* System failures or timeouts
* Invalid values in fields
* Incomplete forms or surveys

**Identifying Missing Data:**

* Typically appears as `null` (in databases) or `NaN` (in Pandas)
* Can also be custom-encoded (e.g., negative values where only positives are expected)
* Use `df.describe()` and `df.isna()` in Pandas to detect missingness

**Why It's Important:**

* Most ML algorithms cannot handle missing values directly and may drop affected rows
* Identifying and addressing missing data improves model reliability and accuracy

### üõ†Ô∏è **Common Strategies to Handle Missing Values**

1. **Drop Rows or Columns**

   * Use if missing values are few or if a column is mostly missing
   * Helps avoid unreliable records caused by systemic collection errors

2. **Imputation**

   * Fill missing values with:

     * Mean or median (median preferred for skewed data)
     * A specific value
   * Simple and commonly used

3. **Interpolation / Predictive Imputation**

   * Use other correlated features to build a predictive model to estimate the missing value
   * More advanced and feature-aware alternative to imputation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* Decisions on how to handle missing data are subjective and should be validated via experimentation
* Always apply the **same pre-processing steps** to all datasets (training, validation, test, production)
