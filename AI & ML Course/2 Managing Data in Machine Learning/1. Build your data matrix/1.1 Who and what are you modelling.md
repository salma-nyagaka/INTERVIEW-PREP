**Defining the Unit of Analysis** is crucial in machine learning and should be clearly stated in the initial problem definition. It influences every step of model building.

Each problem type has a different **unit of analysis**, such as:

* Fraud detection: **transaction**
* Marketing: **reader-ad pair**
* Recommendation: **user-tweet pair**
* Telemetry: **engine**

The **unit of analysis** determines what each row in your data matrix represents — whether it's a single entity or a pair. Data tables should include corresponding **ID columns** to track units and enable proper merging, but these IDs are **not features** and should be excluded when training models to avoid data leakage.
