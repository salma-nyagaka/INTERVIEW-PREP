- When choosing data for your model to generalize well to new data, you need to select a sample that reflects the larger distribution of data.

Here’s a **concise summary** of the video on **sampling in machine learning**:

### 🔍 **What is Sampling?**

Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of examples from a larger dataset. It is important in two contexts:

1. **Defining the population** you want your model to learn from.
2. **Managing dataset size** for efficient model training.

---

### 🧩 **Key Concepts:**

* **Unit of Analysis**: First, define what the individual "thing" you're modeling is (e.g., a transaction, a user-ad pair).

* **Sample Population**: Then, specify any **attributes** (e.g., only web transactions, non-subscribers, new users) that further refine your population.

* You may build **different models for different subgroups**, such as new vs. tenured users or subscribers vs. non-subscribers.

---

### 📊 **Why It Matters:**

* Your model should be trained on the **same population** it will be used to predict for — otherwise, performance will suffer due to lack of generalization.

* Visuals (e.g., circles and overlaps) illustrate how **populations and subpopulations** differ and why careful sampling matters.

---

### 🔁 **IID Sampling:**

* Samples should be **independent and identically distributed (IID)** — achieved by random sampling — to ensure reliable training.

---

### ⚖️ **Fairness and Representation:**

* **Underrepresented groups** (e.g., by race or orientation) may lead to biased models.
* To improve fairness:

  * Evaluate model performance across subgroups.
  * **Resample** to ensure balanced representation in training data.

---

### 📈 **Sample Size vs. Performance:**

* More data generally improves model performance, though with **diminishing returns**.
* Focus on **quality and balance**, not just quantity.

---

### ✅ **Summary Steps:**

1. Define the **target population** (unit + key attributes).
2. Randomly **sample** from it.
3. Ensure your training population matches the **prediction population**.
4. Address **fairness** by checking subgroup performance and resampling if needed.
