This section focuses on the **data preparation stage** of the model development workflow, specifically **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. EDA has two main goals:

1. **Ensure high-quality data**, defined here as data with minimal missing values or outliers.
2. **Gain insights** to better understand the problem and inform model decisions.

Three key questions guide EDA in supervised learning:

* **How is the data distributed?** (to detect skewness or outliers)
* **Which features are redundant?** (to decide what to keep or drop)
* **How do features correlate with the label?** (to identify predictive features)

The process starts by **visually inspecting the data**, either using Linux commands (`head`, `cat`, `wc`) or tools like **Pandas** in Python. This early inspection helps check file structure, delimiters, missing values, and dataset size.

Continual **visual checks during processing** act as "unit tests" to catch issues like incorrect formatting or missing records early in the pipeline.
