### **Exploring Variable Dependencies: Correlation vs. Mutual Information**

As part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), understanding **dependencies between variables** (features-to-features and features-to-labels) is key. Two common approaches are:

* **Correlation**: Measures the **strength and direction** of a **linear relationship** between variables.
* **Mutual Information**: Measures the **reduction in uncertainty** of one variable **given** knowledge of another — capturing both **linear and non-linear** dependencies.

Both techniques provide insight into how variables relate and are essential tools for feature selection and model interpretability.

## Correlation and Mutual Information in Feature Engineering

**Purpose**: These concepts help identify the most relevant features for prediction while avoiding redundancy and reducing computational cost.

## Mutual Information

**Definition**: Measures how much uncertainty reduction one variable provides about another, ranging from 0 to 1.

**Key Formula**: 
I(x₁, x₂) = H(x₁) - H(x₁|x₂) = H(x₂) - H(x₂|x₁)

**Interpretation**: 
- Built on information theory and entropy concepts
- Higher mutual information = variables are more informative about each other
- Can detect both linear and non-linear relationships
- Visualized through Venn diagrams showing overlap between variable entropies

## Correlation and Covariance

**Covariance**: Measures linear dependency between variables
- Formula: Cov(x,y) = Σ(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ)/(N-1)
- Unbounded values make it hard to interpret

**Pearson Correlation**: Standardized covariance ranging from -1 to 1
- Formula: Corr(x,y) = Cov(x,y)/(σₓσᵧ)
- Easier to interpret and compare across variable pairs

**Visual Examples**:
- High positive correlation: Strong upward linear trend
- Near zero correlation: No clear linear relationship  
- High negative correlation: Strong downward linear trend

## Practical Application

Use these metrics to:
- Select features with high correlation/mutual information with the target
- Remove redundant features that are highly correlated with each other
- Balance model complexity with predictive performance
