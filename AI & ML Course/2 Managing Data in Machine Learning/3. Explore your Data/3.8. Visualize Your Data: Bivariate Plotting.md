### **Visualizing Relationships Between Two Variables (Bivariate Plots)**

This section covers basic plotting techniques to understand **how two features relate**, especially the relationship between **features and the label**—a critical part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

### **Goals of Bivariate Plotting**

1. **Detect correlation** between features (to drop redundant ones).
2. **Understand feature-label relationships** (to guide feature selection and explain model behavior).

### **Plotting Techniques Covered**

#### 1. **Scatter Plots (Numeric vs. Numeric)**

* Show correlation between two numeric features.
* The **shape of the scatter** reflects correlation strength.
* **High dispersion** = weak correlation; **tight line** = strong correlation.
* Ideal:

  * Low correlation between features.
  * High (positive or negative) correlation with the label.
* **Caution**: Pearson's correlation only detects **linear** relationships. Nonlinear relationships (e.g., a variable vs. its square) can have **zero correlation** despite being strongly related.

#### 2. **Bar Plots (Categorical Feature vs. Binary Label)**

* Show average label value for each category.
* Useful for assessing **predictive power** of categorical features.
* **Error bars** (e.g., in Seaborn) can indicate statistical significance.
* Great for communicating insights to non-technical audiences.

#### 3. **Binned Bar Plots (Numeric Feature vs. Binary Label)**

* **Bin numeric features** into intervals (e.g., every 20 units).
* Treat bins as categories and apply bar plots.
* Helps reveal **trends and correlations** in numeric data when a direct plot isn’t possible.

### **Why This Matters**

* These plots support the **three core EDA goals**:

  1. Understand data distribution.
  2. Identify redundant features.
  3. Explore correlations with the label.
* They also **build trust** in your models—especially valuable in regulated fields like finance or insurance.
