    "You already encountered ways to quickly overview what your data looks like using Pandas. (Don't worry, if memory fails, we will revisit that material below!)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to get the initial impression of the data before loading it into a Pandas DataFrame. <br>\n",
    "How does one look at file contents? We are all used to visual interfaces, like the file browser on your computer, and it may be tempting to simply navigate (using a file explorer on WIndows or Finder on Mac) to where your data file is located and open it. However, there are a few good reasons not to do so:<br>\n",
    "- The file may be in a **format** that is not immediately readable by a text editor (one example of such formats is `.json`, and it is very commonly used)\n",
    "- The file may be **prohibitively large**: it may contain so many lines that trying to open it in a text editor may hang your software.\n",
    "- For most purposes, you do not strictly need to look at *all* entries &mdash; usually, what we are after is simply getting a sense of how many rows and columns there are, how they are separated, and what is the type of values stored in each column. Hence, we **don't need to view all lines**, and trying to load the whole file would be overkill.\n",
    "- You may be working off **terminal / command line**, where you may not have access to window-based file browsing nor a text editor software with a nice GUI (graphical user interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about this last one. In machine learning jobs, you will often execute your code on a *remote server* in the cloud. That is, you will only use *your* machine to communicate with a (powerful) *remote* machine, and all the computation will be running not on your computer, but on that remote server. You will only use your machine to either edit and upload your code to a cloud instance, or you will edit it remotely and your machine will be a mere access interface to edit, manipulate, and run your project in the cloud. While working on a cloud server instance, it is typical to channel commands via the **command line**, where the options for displaying file contents are limited, and the end result is not very easy to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For all of these reasons, it is best to avoid opening data files using a command line text editing software, and instead develop a habit of doing the initial data exploration via  command line commands (even if you are working in Jupyter Notebooks!). Below, we show how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When talking about channeling **Linux** commands via the **command line**, people will sometimes use terms such as **terminal** or **console** instead. Strictly, the terminal and the console are *interfaces* that allow you to access the command line. You can use any of these terms to refer to sending commands to your computer using a text interface, and people will generally know what you mean.\n",
