### **Understanding Data Through Basic Plotting**

This section introduces **basic plotting techniques** to complement summary statistics and enhance exploratory data analysis.

#### **Two Main Plotting Goals:**

1. **Univariate Analysis** – Understand the distribution of a single feature (range, central tendency, skew, variance).
2. **Multivariate Analysis** – Explore relationships between features or between features and the label (helps with detecting correlation or redundancy).

#### **Key Plot Type: Histogram**

* A histogram shows how data is distributed across intervals.
* **X-axis**: feature values (e.g., `uniq_urls` from 0 to 200)
* **Y-axis**: frequency or percentage of records in each range

#### **Insights from Histograms:**

* Can reveal **multi-modal distributions** (multiple peaks), which may not appear in `.describe()`.
* Help identify **skewed data** or **outliers**, and inform transformations like **log scaling** (e.g., `num_checkins` transformed to look normally distributed).
* Useful for both **numeric and categorical** features.
* Can guide **feature selection** and **data transformations** to improve model performance.

#### **Tools Used:**

* Libraries: **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
* Histogram methods work similarly for both numeric and categorical x-axis values.

#### **Takeaway:**

Use both **Pandas `.describe()`** and **histograms** together—each reveals different, valuable insights about the data’s distribution and quality.
