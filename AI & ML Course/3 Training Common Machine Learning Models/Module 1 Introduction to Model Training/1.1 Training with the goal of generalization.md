## Summary: Training Goals and Key Concepts in Machine Learning

**Primary Goal**: Create an accurate model that generalizes well to new, unseen data.

**Two Key Considerations:**

**1. Minimize Loss**
- Loss measures how many mistakes your model makes
- It quantifies the difference between actual labels and predicted labels
- Goal: Achieve low training loss (few prediction errors)
- Uses loss functions as mathematical tools to measure prediction quality

**2. Avoid Overfitting**
- **Problem**: A model may achieve low training loss but fail on new data
- **Cause**: Model adapts too well to specific training data nuances/noise
- **Result**: Poor generalization to previously unseen data
- **Illustration**: A complex model (green line) that perfectly fits training data vs. a smoother model (black line) that generalizes better

**Key Distinction**: 
- Don't just minimize loss on training data
- Minimize **expected loss** on new, unseen data
- Training data is only a finite sample from a larger theoretical distribution

**Core Challenge**: Balance between achieving low training loss while maintaining the ability to generalize - essentially creating the best possible model without overfitting. This balance is fundamental to all supervised learning algorithms and will be the focus of subsequent learning.
