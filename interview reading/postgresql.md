## Fundamentals

### 1. What is PostgreSQL and its key features?
PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS).

**Key features:**
- ACID compliance
- Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)
- Extensible type system
- Advanced indexing
- Full-text search
- JSON/JSONB support
- Procedural languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Python)
- Standards compliance (SQL:2016)

### 2. What are the differences between PostgreSQL and other databases?

| Feature | PostgreSQL | MySQL | Oracle | SQL Server |
|---------|------------|--------|--------|------------|
| **License** | Open Source | Open Source/Commercial | Commercial | Commercial |
| **ACID** | Full | InnoDB only | Full | Full |
| **Data Types** | Rich (JSON, arrays, custom) | Basic | Rich | Rich |
| **Extensibility** | High | Limited | High | Medium |
| **Performance** | Complex queries | Simple queries | Enterprise | Enterprise |
| **Standards** | Strict SQL | Lenient | Proprietary extensions | T-SQL |

### 3. What is MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)?
MVCC allows multiple transactions to access the same data simultaneously without blocking each other.

**How it works:**
- Each transaction sees a snapshot of data
- Updates create new row versions
- Old versions remain until no longer needed
- No read locks required

**Benefits:**
- High concurrency
- Consistent reads
- No deadlocks for read operations

### 4. What are PostgreSQL system catalogs?
System catalogs are metadata tables that store information about database objects like tables, columns, indexes, users, and statistics.

### 5. What is the difference between CHAR, VARCHAR, and TEXT?
- **CHAR(n)** - Fixed length, padded with spaces
- **VARCHAR(n)** - Variable length, up to n characters  
- **TEXT** - Variable length, unlimited

**Performance:** CHAR is faster for fixed-length data, VARCHAR is good for variable data with known limits, TEXT is best for large, variable text.

## Database Design

### 6. What are database normalization forms?

**1NF (First Normal Form):**
- Atomic values only
- No repeating groups

**2NF (Second Normal Form):**
- 1NF + No partial dependencies
- Non-key attributes depend on entire primary key

**3NF (Third Normal Form):**
- 2NF + No transitive dependencies
- Non-key attributes depend only on primary key

**BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):**
- 3NF + Every determinant is a candidate key

### 7. What are PostgreSQL constraints and their types?
- **Primary Key** - Unique identifier for rows
- **Foreign Key** - References another table's primary key, supports CASCADE options
- **Unique** - Ensures column values are unique
- **Check** - Validates data meets specific conditions
- **Not Null** - Prevents NULL values
- **Exclusion** - PostgreSQL-specific constraint preventing overlapping values

### 8. What is referential integrity?
Referential integrity ensures relationships between tables remain consistent through foreign key constraints with options like CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT, and SET DEFAULT.

### 9. What are database schemas?
Schemas are logical containers for database objects that help organize and namespace database elements. You can create schemas, set search paths, and manage object access through schema-level permissions.

---

## SQL Queries & JOINs

### 10. What are different types of JOINs and when to use each?

**INNER JOIN:**
- Returns only matching records from both tables
- Most restrictive JOIN type
- Use when you need data that exists in both tables

*Example: Get customers who have placed orders*
```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN):**
- Returns all records from left table and matching records from right table
- NULL values for non-matching right table records
- Use when you want all records from the main table regardless of matches

*Example: Get all customers and their orders (including customers with no orders)*
```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN):**
- Returns all records from right table and matching records from left table
- NULL values for non-matching left table records
- Less commonly used than LEFT JOIN

*Example: Get all orders and customer info (including orders without customer data)*
```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN:**
- Returns all records from both tables
- NULL values where no matches exist
- Use when you want all data from both tables

*Example: Get all customers and all orders, showing relationships where they exist*
```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**CROSS JOIN:**
- Cartesian product of both tables
- Every row from first table paired with every row from second table
- Use carefully as it can produce very large result sets

*Example: Generate all possible product-category combinations*
```sql
SELECT p.product_name, c.category_name
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN categories c;
```

**SELF JOIN:**
- Table joined with itself
- Use aliases to distinguish between instances
- Common for hierarchical data (employee-manager relationships)

*Example: Find employees and their managers*
```sql
SELECT e.name as employee, m.name as manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

### 11. What are JOIN performance considerations?

**Optimization tips:**
- Create indexes on JOIN columns
- Use appropriate JOIN order (smaller table first)
- Consider EXIST vs IN for subqueries
- Use WHERE clauses to filter early
- Analyze execution plans with EXPLAIN

**JOIN algorithms:**
- **Nested Loop Join** - Good for small datasets
- **Hash Join** - Efficient for equality conditions
- **Merge Join** - Best for sorted data or range conditions

### 12. How do you handle NULL values in JOINs?
- NULL values don't match other NULL values in standard JOINs
- Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL in WHERE clauses
- COALESCE() function to handle NULL values
- FULL OUTER JOIN to include NULL-producing rows

### 13. What are correlated vs non-correlated subqueries?

**Non-correlated subquery:**
- Independent of outer query
- Executed once
- Can be run standalone

**Correlated subquery:**
- References columns from outer query
- Executed for each row of outer query
- Cannot be run independently
- Often slower but sometimes necessary for complex logic

### 14. What is the difference between EXISTS and IN?

**EXISTS:**
- Returns TRUE/FALSE based on subquery results
- Better performance for large subqueries
- Handles NULL values correctly
- Stops at first match (short-circuit evaluation)

**IN:**
- Compares values directly
- Performance issues with NULL values
- Can be problematic with large result sets
- Must evaluate all subquery results

### 15. When would you use UNION vs UNION ALL?

**UNION:**
- Removes duplicate rows
- Performs implicit DISTINCT operation
- Slower due to duplicate removal
- Use when duplicates are not wanted

**UNION ALL:**
- Keeps all rows including duplicates
- Faster performance
- Use when duplicates are acceptable or known not to exist

### 16. What are window functions and their types?

**Ranking functions:**
- ROW_NUMBER() - Unique sequential numbers
- RANK() - Same rank for ties, gaps in sequence
- DENSE_RANK() - Same rank for ties, no gaps

**Aggregate window functions:**
- SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX() with OVER clause
- Running totals and moving averages

**Offset functions:**
- LAG() - Previous row value
- LEAD() - Next row value
- FIRST_VALUE() - First value in window
- LAST_VALUE() - Last value in window

### 17. What are Common Table Expressions (CTEs)?

**Simple CTE:**
- Named temporary result set
- Exists only for duration of query
- Improves readability
- Can be referenced multiple times

**Recursive CTE:**
- References itself
- Useful for hierarchical data
- Tree traversals and graph operations
- Has base case and recursive case

### 18. How do you optimize complex JOIN queries?

**Strategies:**
- Use appropriate indexes on JOIN columns
- Filter early with WHERE clauses
- Choose optimal JOIN order
- Consider query rewriting
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand execution
- Partition large tables if necessary

- Smaller than B-tree for simple equality

**GiST indexes:**
- Generalized Search Tree
- Geometric data, full-text search
- Extensible framework

**GIN indexes:**
- Generalized Inverted Index
- Arrays, JSONB, full-text search
- Good for multi-value data types

**BRIN indexes:**
- Block Range Index
- Large tables with natural ordering
- Very small index size

### 20. What are partial indexes?
Indexes created with a WHERE clause that only index rows meeting specific conditions. They save space and improve performance when you frequently query a subset of data.

### 21. What are composite indexes?
Multi-column indexes where column order matters for query optimization. They're effective for queries that filter on the leftmost columns of the index.

### 22. How do you identify unused indexes?
Monitor index usage statistics through system views to find indexes that are never or rarely used, which may be candidates for removal to improve write performance.

### 23. What are expression indexes?
Indexes built on function results or expressions rather than column values directly. Useful for queries that filter on computed values or function results.
