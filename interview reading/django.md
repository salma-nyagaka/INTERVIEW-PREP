# Django 2.1.7

## What is Django?

Django is a web programming framework built on Python. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications by offering features like admin functionality, ORM, and easy migrations.

---

## Higher-Order Functions (HOF)

A higher-order function:

* Takes another function as an argument.
* Returns a function.
* Functions in Python are **first-class objects**:

  * Can be stored in variables
  * Passed as arguments
  * Returned from other functions
  * Stored in data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries)

---

## Advantages of Django

* **Batteries Included**:
  Django comes with built-in features like:

  * ORM
  * Migrations
  * MVT architecture
  * User authentication (`auth`)
  * Admin interface
  * Multisite, multilingual support
  * RSS, Atom feeds, APIs, sessions, and messages
  * AJAX, sitemaps, and URL routing

* **Smart for AI/ML**:
  Great for projects using NumPy, PyTorch, and other AI libraries.

* **Pythonic**:
  Clean, readable, and productive syntax from Python.

* **Versatile and Scalable**:
  Used for large-scale apps (even the busiest websites).

* **Strong Community**:
  Well-maintained documentation and active ecosystem.

* **Rapid Development**:
  Enables fast MVP and prototyping.

* **Flexible**:
  Can be quickly configured and customized.

* **Secure**:
  Prevents SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, and more.

---

## Disadvantages of Django

* **Lacks Convention Over Configuration**:
  More explicit setup compared to frameworks like Ruby on Rails.

* **Monolithic Nature**:
  Rigid structureâ€”requires following Djangoâ€™s patterns.

* **Heavy for Small Projects**:
  Too much overhead for simple apps.

* **Not Fully Asynchronous**:
  Doesnâ€™t handle multiple simultaneous requests efficiently.

* **Steep Learning Curve**:
  Difficult for beginners or those coming from other stacks.

## Key Django Files & Concepts

| File/Term        | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `app`            | A Python package within a Django project.     |
| `__init__.py`    | Initializes a Python package.                 |
| `models.py`      | Defines database schema (models).             |
| `views.py`       | Contains logic for handling HTTP requests.    |
| `urls.py`        | Routes URLs to views.                         |
| `apps.py`        | App configuration.                            |
| `manage.py`      | Command-line utility for project management.  |
| `wsgi.py`        | Entry point for WSGI servers.                 |

| `__pycache__`    | Stores compiled bytecode.                     |
| `Virtualenv`     | Isolated Python environment.                  |
| `SECRET_KEY`     | Used for cryptographic signing.               |

---

## Serializers

Used to convert complex data like querysets to native Python types and JSON.

---

## Django Architecture (MVT)

* **Model**: Defines data structure.
* **View**: Business logic, returns HTTP responses.
* **Template**: Presentation layer using HTML.

---

## PEP 8 & Design Philosophies

* **Loose Coupling, Tight Cohesion**
* **Less Code**: Avoid boilerplate
* **Quick Development**
* **DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)**
* **Consistency**: At both low and high levels

---

## GitHub Actions

Automated workflows:

* Run tests
* Ensure PR approval
* Prevent merge conflicts

---

## Tools Used in Projects

* **E-commerce platforms**
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
* **Celery**: Asynchronous task runner
* **Redis**: In-memory cache/store
* **Docker**: Containerization
* **Kubernetes**: Deployment at scale
* **cProfile**: Performance profiling
* **Linting**: `flake8`, `pep8`

---

## Python Concepts

### Memory Management

* Python uses a private heap.
* Managed by the Python Memory Manager.
* Includes sharing, segmentation, preallocation, and caching.

### Pass by Value or Reference?

* Python passes **object references by value**.
* Mutables can be changed inside functions; immutables cannot.

### Lambda Closures

* A lambda can capture variables from enclosing scopes.

---

## Unit Testing

### Good Unit Tests Are:

* Easy to write
* Readable
* Reliable
* Clear in their intent
* Do not rely on external systems

### `setUp()` and `tearDown()`

* `setUp()`: Runs before each test
* `tearDown()`: Runs after each test

---

## REST API vs RPC

* **REST (Representational State Transfer)**:
  Access resources via URLs and HTTP methods.

* **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**:
  Executes functions directly on a remote server.

---

## Threads & GIL

* Python has a **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**.
* Limits true parallelism with threads.
* For I/O-bound tasks, threads are okay.
* For CPU-bound tasks, use **multiprocessing**.

### Producer/Consumer Threads

Yes, producer/consumer threading works, but GIL prevents true concurrency in CPU tasks.

---

## List & Dict Comprehensions

### List Comprehension:

```python
[i * 2 for i in range(5)]
```

### Dict Comprehension:

```python
{k: v*2 for k, v in dict1.items()}
```

---

## Functional Examples

### `filter()` and `reduce()`:

```python
from functools import reduce
print(list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])))
print(reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

---

## JSON Utilities

| Function       | Description                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `json.dumps()` | Converts Python object to JSON string   |
| `json.loads()` | Parses JSON string to Python dictionary |
| `json.dump()`  | Serializes Python object to JSON file   |
| `json.load()`  | Deserializes JSON from file to Python   |

---

## Multiprocessing vs Multithreading

* **Multithreading**: Concurrent, not parallel due to GIL
* **Multiprocessing**: True parallelism using separate memory and CPU cores

---

## Django Middleware

Middleware hooks into the request/response cycle to:

* Modify requests
* Modify responses
* Perform checks or processing

---

## Avoiding Migration Conflicts

* Use `makemigrations` and `migrate` consistently
* Coordinate with teammates
* Review migration history before committing

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

* Monitor **metrics**, **logs**, and **user feedback**
* Use tools like **New Relic**, **Sentry**, **Prometheus**, or **Grafana**

---

## Django REST Framework (DRF)

### What is DRF?

DRF is a powerful, flexible Django extension for building Web APIs.

### Why Use DRF?

* Unified JSON-based backend for multiple platforms
* Simplifies backend/frontend separation
* Scalable and maintainable code
* Organization-friendly: avoids template engine limitations

---

## Security Concepts

* **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**:
  Prevents malicious requests from authenticated users.

* **Clickjacking Protection**:
  Prevents UI redress attacks (e.g., using `X-Frame-Options`)

---

## Python 2.x vs 3.x Comparison

| Feature    | Python 2.x             | Python 3.x               |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Print      | `print "Hello"`        | `print("Hello")`         |
| Exceptions | `except Exception, e:` | `except Exception as e:` |
| Strings    | ASCII by default       | Unicode by default       |
| Iteration  | `xrange()`             | `range()`                |
| Division   | `5/2 = 2`              | `5/2 = 2.5`              |
| Libraries  | Not forward compatible | Python 3 only            |
