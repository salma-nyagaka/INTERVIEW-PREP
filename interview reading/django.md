# Django, DRF, Microservices & APIs: Definitions + Interview Q&A

## Definitions

### Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the "batteries included" philosophy. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for rapid web development, including ORM, admin interface, authentication, URL routing, templating, and security features. Django follows the Model-Template-View (MTV) architectural pattern and emphasizes reusability, rapid development, and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Django REST Framework (DRF)
Django REST Framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit built on top of Django for building Web APIs. It provides serialization, authentication, permissions, viewsets, routers, pagination, filtering, and throttling capabilities. DRF makes it easy to build RESTful APIs with minimal code while maintaining flexibility and extensibility.

### Microservices
Microservices is an architectural approach where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is responsible for a specific business function, can be developed and deployed independently, and typically manages its own database. This contrasts with monolithic architecture where all components are tightly coupled.

### APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
APIs are sets of protocols, routines, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs act as intermediaries between different software components, enabling integration and data sharing across systems.

### PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)
PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community, describing new features, processes, or environment changes for Python. PEPs are the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input, and documenting design decisions.

### Database Views
Database views are virtual tables created from the result of stored queries. They don't store data themselves but provide a way to present data from one or more tables in a specific format. Views simplify complex queries, provide security by restricting access to specific columns/rows, and offer a consistent interface to underlying data.

## Django Project Structure and Files

### 1. How do you create a Django project?
Use the command: django-admin startproject project_name. This creates the main project directory with essential configuration files including settings.py, urls.py, wsgi.py, asgi.py, and manage.py.

### 2. How do you create a Django app?
Navigate to the project directory and use: python manage.py startapp app_name. This creates an app directory with models.py, views.py, urls.py, admin.py, apps.py, tests.py, and migrations folder.

### 3. What is the purpose of manage.py?
manage.py is a command-line utility that provides various Django administrative tasks. It allows you to run the development server, create migrations, apply migrations, create superusers, collect static files, and run tests. It's the main entry point for Django management commands.

### 4. Explain the Django project structure and key files
**Project Directory**: Contains global settings and configuration
**Apps**: Modular components containing specific functionality
**manage.py**: Command-line utility for administrative tasks
**settings.py**: Project configuration and settings
**urls.py**: URL routing configuration

### 8. What is models.py and its purpose?
models.py defines database models using Django's ORM. It contains class definitions that represent database tables, field definitions, relationships between models, model methods, and meta options. Models handle data logic and database interactions.

- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that creates a "virtual object database" that can be used from within a programming language. It acts as a bridge between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases, allowing developers to work with database records as if they were objects in their programming language rather than writing raw SQL queries.

### 9. What is views.py and its function?
views.py contains view functions and classes that handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. Views process business logic, interact with models, prepare data for templates, and handle form submissions. Views act as controllers in the MTV pattern.

### 10. What is admin.py used for?
admin.py configures the Django admin interface. It registers models with the admin site, customizes admin displays, defines admin actions, sets up filters and search functionality, and controls admin permissions. It provides an automatic admin interface for managing data.

### 15. What are database views in Django?
Database views in Django are implemented using raw SQL or custom managers. They provide read-only access to complex queries, improve performance for frequently accessed data, simplify complex joins, and can be used with Django models through unmanaged models or custom database views.

### 16. How do you create and use database views in Django?
Create views using raw SQL in migrations, define unmanaged models to represent views, use custom managers for complex queries, implement views in the database directly, and access views through Django ORM using appropriate model configurations.

### 17. Difference between Django's select_related() and prefetch_related()
**select_related()**: Uses SQL joins to fetch related objects in single query, works with ForeignKey and OneToOneField
**prefetch_related()**: Uses separate queries to fetch related objects, works with ManyToManyField and reverse ForeignKey relationships

### 18. What are Django signals and when to use them?
Signals allow decoupled applications to get notified when certain actions occur. Common signals include pre_save, post_save, pre_delete, post_delete. Use for logging, cache invalidation, or triggering side effects without tight coupling.

### 19. Explain Django middleware and its use cases
Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django's request/response processing. It's processed during request and response phases. Use cases include authentication, CORS handling, logging, security headers, and request/response modification.

### 27. Difference between APIView, ViewSet, and GenericAPIView
**APIView**: Basic view class with HTTP method handlers
**GenericAPIView**: Provides common functionality for list/detail views
**ViewSet**: Groups multiple related views, works with routers for automatic URL generation

#### APIView
**Purpose**: Basic class-based view with full control
**Characteristics**: Manual HTTP method implementation, no built-in features
**Example**:
```python
class BookAPIView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        # Manual implementation
    def post(self, request):
        # Manual implementation
```

#### GenericAPIView  
**Purpose**: APIView with built-in features (pagination, filtering, serialization)
**Characteristics**: Less boilerplate, queryset/serializer attributes
**Example**:
```python
class BookListCreate(ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
    # Automatic list/create functionality
```

#### ViewSet
**Purpose**: Groups related views, works with routers for automatic URL generation
**Characteristics**: Action-based (list, create, retrieve), automatic CRUD
**Example**:
```python
class BookViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
    # Automatic CRUD operations

# Router automatically generates all URLs
router.register('books', BookViewSet)
```

## Quick Decision Guide

| Use Case | Choose |
|----------|--------|
| **Full control needed** | APIView |
| **Standard CRUD + customization** | GenericAPIView |
| **Standard REST API, minimal code** | ViewSet |

## URL Patterns

- **APIView**: Manual URL mapping for each view
- **GenericAPIView**: Manual URL mapping for each view  
- **ViewSet**: Automatic URL generation with routers

**Bottom Line**: APIView → full control, GenericAPIView → built-in features, ViewSet → automatic everything.

### 28. How does DRF handle authentication and permissions?
**Authentication**: Identifies the user making request (Token, Session, JWT, Basic)
**Permissions**: Determines if authenticated user can perform specific action (IsAuthenticated, IsOwner, custom permissions)

### 29. What is DRF throttling and its types?
Throttling controls the rate of requests users can make. Types include:
**AnonRateThrottle**: For anonymous users
**UserRateThrottle**: For authenticated users
