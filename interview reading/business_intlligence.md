# Business Intelligence (BI) - Definition

## What is Business Intelligence?

**Business Intelligence** is a technology-driven process that combines business analytics, data mining, data visualization, data tools and infrastructure, and best practices to help organizations make more data-driven decisions. It transforms raw data into meaningful insights that drive strategic business actions.

• **Data Storage** - Data warehouses and data marts for centralized storage
• **Data Processing** - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
• **Data Analysis** - Statistical analysis and pattern recognition
• **Data Visualization** - Dashboards, reports, and charts
• **Decision Making** - Converting insights into business actions

## Main Functions

• **Reporting** - Generate regular business reports
• **Analytics** - Analyze trends and patterns
• **Dashboards** - Real-time visual displays of KPIs
• **Data Mining** - Discover hidden patterns in large datasets
• **Forecasting** - Predict future trends and outcomes
• **Performance Monitoring** - Track business metrics and goals

## Popular BI Tools
